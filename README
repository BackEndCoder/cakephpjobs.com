This is code from a school project to show proficiency 
with the PHP language. I created a simple Job Listing 
web application.

The application allows users to post jobs using a 
form wizard, and it displays all jobs for 30 days. 
Developers can also create a profile which 
employers can view and make contact with the right 
developer.

Built using CakePHP, MySQL, and some jQuery.
